# What is OSINT?
**OSINT** or **Open Source Intelligence** is gathering information from publicly available sources to learn about a target (person, organization, system or event). **Open Source** means the information is already public. We are not breaking into systems or bypassing passwords. We are just really good at finding and connecting publicly visible dots. Think of it like a detective who:
- Reads, newspaper. social media and public records.
- Looks at satellite images anyone can access.
- Checks public business registrations.
- Analyzes photos for hidden clures (metadata, landmarks).

All of this is legal and ethical when done properly.

## Specific Tools We Need to Know

### 1. Google Dorking.
Google Dorks are advanced search operators that let you find very specific things that regular searches miss. It's not "hacking google" - it's using google's own advanced features to find information that happens to be publicly accessible. Example: Instead of typing: `company confidential documents` we search: `site:github.com filetype:pdf "confidential"`. This tells Google: "Only search within company.com, only returns PDF files, and inly if they contain the word 'confidential'."  

Common Operators are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>What it does</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>site:</td>
    <td>Search only within a specific website.</td>
    <td>site:github.com "password"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>filetype:</td>
    <td>Search for only specific file types.</td>
    <td>filetype:pdf "internal use only"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>intitle:</td>
    <td>Search in the page title only</td>
    <td>intitle:"index of" "passwords"</td>
  </tr>
</table>
